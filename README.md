### CAKE APP - Samsclub - Hackathon ###

Sample App which defines the customer and store associate flows in a typical bakery.

Customer usually logs into the site and starts ordering a cake. He has the option to chose either from a set of signature cakes or else he can also customize cake on his own. Once customized or selected from a signature cake, he would be shown the preview of thecake he selected along with the billing details. He can then proceed to the payment section.

The store associate has a seperate login in which he can view the items ordered by customers in his bakery along with the status. The associate can then start baking the cake or can also forward it to a third party baker, who will bake the cake accordingly. Once the cake is baked, either by the baker or the associate, the associate will change the status of the order to ready for delivery along with  a snap of the baken cake (image captured through mobile). The order once delivered can then be changed to delivered and then a feedback will be trigerred seperately to the customer to capture the feedback about the cake delivered. This can again be saved along with the order details for reference in future.
